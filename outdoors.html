            <h1>Hong Kong UNESCO Global Geopark</h1>
            <h2>Hong Kong UNESCO Global Geopark is the perfect wild, outdoorsy place to explore if you have a sense of adventure and
            time to spare.</h2>

                    <h1>A good first stop</h1>
                    <p>In 2011, the park was included in UNESCO's Global Geopark Network for its diverse volcanic rock formations. The best way
                    to explore the many islands with their different erosion tracks is by boat and on foot. A good first stop is the Volcano
                    Discovery Centre on Sai Kung Promenade. Here visitors can find out about the best tours and the many different rock
                    formations.
            
            
            
                    On High Island at the East Dam of High Island Reservoir, the unique hexagonal volcanic fissures are found along the
                    coast. The High Island Geo-Hiking Trail passes other geological features. Also worth seeing are the eroding landscapes
                    of Tai Long Wan.

                    <h1>Cliffs and Rocks</h1>
                    <p>On the western edge of Sai Kung, igneous rocks characterize Sharp Island. A sedimentary coastal landscape with a nearly
                    250 sandbar connects the island with neighboring Kiu Tau Island. At low tide, this creates a temporary bridge.
            
                    The Ung Kong Group consists of Bluff Island, Wang Chau Island and Basalt Island. The forces of sea and wind have formed
                    numerous steep cliffs and sea arks.</p>

                    <h1>Several small rocky islands</h1>
                    <p>The Ninepin Group consists of several small rocky islands. North Ninepin Island has the most impressive landforms. Here,
                    too, are the distinctive hexagonal rock crevices formed by millions of years of rock abrasion and erosion. At Double Haven, a rising sea level flooded the river valleys some 6,000 to 8,000 years ago. Indented coastlines with
                    headlands and bays formed. Today's mountains and islands were already formed by volcanic eruptions about 160 million
                    years ago, when lava and volcanic ash formed new rock layers. Later, rivers of sand and stone mixture flowed down from
                    the high mountains and formed the distinctive coastal area.

                    <h1>A red-colored landscape</h1>
                    <p>The crescent-shaped Tung Ping Chau, Hong Kong's easternmost island, is also known for its spectacular rock formations.
                    At 55 million years old, they are the youngest in the Special Administrative Region. With fine layers of limestone and
                    mudstone, they form an eerie-looking landscape. Notable geological sites include Lung Lok Shui, Kang Lau Shek and Cham
                    Keng Chau.
            
            
            
                    Port Island features China Danxia, a red-colored landscape typical of China. Thanks to the abundant iron oxide found
                    here, the limestones and sandstones glow a rich rusty red. The cape of Bluff Head was formed by the sedimentation at
                    river mouths about 400 million years ago and was pushed up under the influence of geological movements. Weathering and
                    coastal erosion created one of Hong Kong's most famous rocks: the Devils Fist. The oldest rock formations in Hong Kong
                    are found along the coast from Tolo Channel.</p>

            <h2>hike along lush green island trails, admire geological wonders and enjoy fresh seafood</h2>
            <p>Nestled in the northeastern New Territories, the mountainous Sai Kung West Country Park and nearby islands around Tolo
            Channel offer wonderful outdoor experiences, thanks to great hiking trails and reliable kaito ferry services. They are
            part of the Hong Kong UNESCO Global Geopark’s internationally significant geological sites and landscapes, as well as
            protected environmental sites.</p>

            <p>The 3,000-hectare country park and islands are also home to picturesque rolling hills, plateaus, and many old rural
            settlements bordered by feng shui woods. To explore the beautiful nature and the rich culture and history of the area,
            start with a hike from the Hakka village of Pak Sha O to Lai Chi Chong, a geosite famous for spectacular rock formations
            — and Instagrammable photo opportunities. Then, hop on a kaito to Tap Mun (Grass Island), home to a peaceful fishing
            village with seafood restaurants that offer a taste of its fine culinary culture.</p>
